# Simple Presentation Timer

Two Bash scripts that can be used as timers when preparing for a presentation.

Both of them play a sound after 5, 6, and 7 minutes respectively, letting you know that you're towards the end of the planned timeframe of the presentation you're rehearsing.

In addition to the sound effect, one of them uses `notify-send` for desktop notifications (which include icons of flags with different colours) while the other one only prints messages of different colours to the standard terminal output.
